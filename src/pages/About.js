        <h2>ILLUSTRATOR AND STREAMER</h2>
        <p>I’m a freelance illustrator and animator specializing in colourful children’s illustrations and lettering. I love drawing fun characters and sometimes make short films too.</p>
        <p>I grew up in a small village but soon decided to move to Hamburg to study graphic design. In 2014, I graduated with my short film »looks« that has to this day been screened at more than 100 festivals all over the world. In 2019 I finished my master studies with my two children's books “Boys Will Be…” and “Girls Are Pretty…”, published by Hardie Grant Egmont/Little Hare Books. </p>
        <p>I have done work for The Washington Post's digital design team, Penguin RandomHouse, Hardie Grant Egmont/Little Hare Books, Editions Milan, CLIFkid, Hanser, CinemaxX Entertainment, Arena, NDR, Bundesverband Deutscher Stiftungen (Association of German Foundations) and Arte Creative.</p>
